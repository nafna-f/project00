PM, Flask App and making those servers run: Naf<br/>

## Description:
A collaborative blog-posting and sharing website that takes a better approach than traditional social media. Users can register, log in, and explore different blog categories such as Sports, Politics, Business, Lifestyle, and Arts. Logged-in users can create, edit, and view blog posts, with options to navigate by category or check out random posts. Each user has access to a personalized interface that adapts based on their actions, such as logged-in vs. logged-out views. Facebook but cooler.
